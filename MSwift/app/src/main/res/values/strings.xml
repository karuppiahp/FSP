We also collect other types of Personal Data that you provide to us voluntarily, such as first name, last name, mailing address, phone number, salary, age, date of birth, gender, education level, and marital status. We may also collect Personal Data, such as demographic information from you via the Services or at other points in our App that state that Personal Data is being collected. You may choose not to provide us with certain information, but this may limit the features that you can use or the functionality of the Services.</p>
            <h1>Personal Data Collected via Technology</h1>
            <p>To make our App and Services more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect Personal Data from you, including internet protocol address, geographic location, operating system, browser type, domain name, and a date/time stamp for your visit. Like most Internet services, we automatically gather this Personal Data and store it in log files each time you visit the App or access your account on the Services.</p>
            <p><b>" \"Cookies\" "</b> are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing a website. We use Cookies and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the solutions and information for which you searched and which you viewed.</p
            <p><b>" \"Web Beacons\" "</b>are images embedded in a Web page or email to measure and analyze App usage and activity. We, or third party providers acting on our behalf, may use Web Beacons to help us analyze App usage and to improve the Services.</p>
            <p><b>Personal Data That We Collect from You About Others.</b> If you decide to invite a third party to use the Services, we will collect such third party’s name and e-mail address so that we may send such third party an invitation to use the Services. You or the third party may contact us at info@getwala.com to request the removal of this information from our database.</p>
            <p><b>Personal and/or Anonymous Data Collected by Third Parties</b>We may receive Personal and/or Anonymous Data about you from other sources like telephone or fax, or from companies that offer their products and/or services on the App ("Third Party Companies"). We may add this information to the information we have already collected from you via the App in order to improve the Services.</p>

             <h1>Use of Your Data</h1>
            <p><b>General Use</b>In general, Personal Data you submit to us is used either to respond to requests that you make, or to aid us in serving you better. Wala uses your Personal Data in the following ways:</p>

                     <p>&#8226; to provide you with the Services;</p>
                    <p>&#8226; to analyze your personal finance activities and reward you with points for your performance of certain activities;</p>
                     <p>&#8226; to personalize and better tailor the features, performance and support of the Services for your use;</p>
                      <p>&#8226; to send you administrative notifications, such as security or support and maintenance advisories;</p>
                       <p>&#8226; to respond to your inquiries related to employment opportunities or other requests;</p>
                        <p>&#8226; to send you promotional/marketing information, newsletters, surveys, offers or other information;</p>
                         <p>&#8226; to provide you with opportunities and functionality that we think would be of particular interest to you;</p>
                          <p>&#8226; to improve the quality of the App and the Services,</p>
                           <p>&#8226; to analyze, benchmark and conduct research on, user data and user interactions with the Services; and</p>
                            <p>&#8226; to conduct market research, planning, troubleshooting, planning problems, detecting and protecting against error, fraud, or other criminal activity;</p>
                             <p>&#8226; to solicit your feedback.</p>



             <p><b>Cookies.</b> We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your phone until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on the App, to tailor the App to your interests, to better understand how you interact with the Services, and to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on the App and Services. We may use third party service providers to help us analyze certain online activities. For example, these service providers may help us analyze visitor activity on the App. We may allow these service providers to use Cookies or other technologies to perform these services for us. We do not share any Personal Data about our customers with these third party service providers, and these service providers do not collect Personal Data on our behalf. Persistent Cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. If you choose to disable Cookies, some areas of the App may not work properly.</p>
             <p><b>Creation of Anonymous Data.</b> We may create Anonymous Data records from Personal Data by excluding information (such as your name) that make the data personally identifiable to you. We use this Anonymous Data to analyze request and usage patterns so that we may enhance the content of the App or the Services and improve App use. Wala reserves the right to use and disclose Anonymous Data to Third Party Companies in its discretion.</p>
              <p><b>Feedback.</b> If you provide feedback on the App or the Services to us, we may use such feedback for any purpose, provided we will not associate such feedback with your Personal Data. Wala will collect any information contained in such communication and will treat the Personal Data in such communication in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

             <h1>Disclosure of Your Personal Data</h1>
             <p>Wala, its subsidiaries, any joint ventures, or other companies under a common control (collectively, "Affiliates"), may in the future share some or all of your Personal Data with each other, in which case we will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy. </p>
             <p><b>Forums, Message Boards and Chats. </b>We may make message boards, chat rooms, and other interactive forums available on the Services. You should be aware that any information which you post to these interactive forums or otherwise choose to make publicly available, including your Personal Data, may be disclosed and available to all users who have access to that portion of the Services, and is therefore no longer private. By using these interactive forums, you agree that we are not responsible for any information that you disclose or communicate in such forums, and any disclosures you make are at your own risk. Please be thoughtful about what you post and make publicly available through the Services.</p>
             <p><b>Other Disclosures. </b>Regardless of any choices you make regarding your Personal Data (as described below), Wala may disclose Personal Data if it believes in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on Wala or (b) protect or defend the rights or property of Wala or other users of the Services.</p>
             <h1>Third Parties</h1>
             <p><b>Links to Third Party Websites.</b> The Services may link to websites operated by third parties that we do not control. This includes any sites that you linked to from advertisements that appear on the Services. Our provision of such links is for your convenience and does not signify our endorsement of such other website or location or its products, services, or contents. When you click on such a link, you will leave our site and go to another site. During this process, another entity may collect Personal Data or Anonymous Data from you. We have no control over, do not review, and cannot be responsible for, these outside websites or their products, services, or content. Please be aware that the terms of this Privacy Policy do not apply to these outside websites, or to any collection of data after you click on links to such outside websites.</p>

             <p><b>Disclosure to Thi1rd Party Service Providers.</b> Except as otherwise stated in this policy, we do not generally sell, trade, share, or rent the Personal Data collected from the Services to other entities. However, we may employ, and share your Personal Data with, third party companies and individuals ("Service Providers") to facilitate or enhance our App or Services, to provide the Services on our behalf, to perform tasks (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database management, web analytics and improvement of the App or Services), to retrieve and store FI Access Information and FI Account Data, or to assist us in analyzing how our Services are used. These third party service providers are required not to use or disclose your Personal Data other than to provide the services requested by us. You expressly consent to the sharing of your Personal Data with our Service Providers for the sole purpose of providing services requested by us.</p>

             <h1>Your Choices Regarding Your Personal Data</h1>

             <p><b>Choices.</b> We offer you choices regarding the collection, use, and sharing of your Personal Data. We may periodically send you newsletters or messages via e-mail, telephone, postal mail, SMS, or social networks that notify you of new points, prizes, winnings, or opportunities available through the App or Services, provide you with updates regarding the App or Services, and directly promote the use of the App or Services and may contain advertisements for Third Party Companies. When you receive newsletters or promotional communications from us, you may indicate a preference to stop receiving further communications from us and you will have the opportunity to "opt-out" by contacting us directly (please see contact information below). Should you decide to opt-out of receiving future communications, we may share your contact information with third parties to ensure that you do not receive further communications from third parties. Despite your indicated preferences, we may send you notices of any updates to our Terms of Service or Privacy Policy.</p>
             <p><b>Changes to Personal Data. </b>You may change any of your Personal Data in your account by editing your profile within the Services. You may request deletion of your Personal Data by us, but please note that we may be required (by law or otherwise) to keep this information and not delete it (or to keep this information for a certain time, in which case we will comply with your deletion request only after we have fulfilled such requirements). When we delete any information, it will be deleted from the active database, but may remain in our archives.</p>
            <h1>Security of Your Personal Data</h1>
            <p>Wala is committed to protecting the security of your Personal Data. We use a variety of industry-standard physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to help protect your Personal Data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We also require you to enter a password to access your account information. Please do not disclose your account password to unauthorized people. From the time you submit your username and password, communications between your computer and the Wala are encrypted using secure socket layer technology to make your information unreadable as it passes over the Internet. While the Wala uses these and other reasonable efforts to protect your Personal Data, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, Wala cannot guarantee absolute security of your Personal Data.</p>

                <p>This Privacy Policy is subject to occasional revision, and if we make any substantial changes in the way we use your Personal Data, we will notify you by sending you an e-mail to the last e-mail address you provided to us and/or by prominently posting notice of the changes on our App. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will be effective immediately if you are a new user of the Services and will be effective thirty (30) calendar days after posting of notice of such changes on the App if you are an existing user, provided that, if you are an existing user, any material changes shall be effective for you upon the earlier of thirty (30) calendar days following posting of notice of such changes on the App or thirty (30) calendar days after dispatch of an e-mail notice of such changes to you.

In the event that the last e-mail address that you have provided us is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you the notice described above, our dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice of the changes described in the notice.
